# Privacy Policy

Updated effective: March 20, 2024


MangoFun ("our", "our" or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the privacy of those who use our products, services and website ("users" or "you"). This Privacy Policy helps you understand what personal information/data (“Personal Information”) and non-personal information we collect and how we use it.


### 1. Scope of this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information submitted and collected through the Services. By installing, using, registering, or otherwise accessing the Services, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not install, use, register or otherwise access the Services. MangoFun reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at a reasonable time, so please check it frequently. Your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of changes to this Privacy Policy.


### 2. Information Collected

personal information 

The information we collect generally falls into two categories:

(1) Data about how users use our services;

(2) Aggregate data about content that users engage with. We may use this information to personalize and improve our services, to meet your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the services. We may provide this information to our partners so they can also provide you with the best experience, but we will never disclose information to our partners in a way that personally identifies you.


non-personal information

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "non-personal information" means information that does not directly identify you. MangoFun may use tools or third-party analytics software to automatically collect and use certain non-personal information that does not directly enable MangoFun to identify you. The third-party SDKs we import will also collect these data. The SDKs we import include Umeng, Facebook Audience Network, AdMob, ironSource, Pangle, AppLovin, Tenjin. The types of non-personal information that MangoFun may collect and use include, but are not limited to:

(1) Device attributes, including but not limited to IP addresses, unique device identifiers, or other permanent or non-permanent device identifiers (“Device Numbers”);

(2) Device software platform and firmware;

(3) Mobile phone operators;

(4) Other non-personal information as reasonably requested by us to enhance the Services and other products and services.

We treat information collected through cookies and similar technologies as non-personal information. A "cookie" is a small piece of record-keeping information that a site typically stores on a user's computer. Cookies do not include names, e-mail addresses, or other personally identifiable information; they are generally used to quickly identify a user's computer and "remember" information about a user's visit. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when a cookie is being sent to your computer.


### 3. Disclosed Information

In addition to the disclosures described here, we may release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. We reserve the right to use personal information legally worldwide, voluntarily or involuntarily, in accordance with applicable laws, including but not limited to: collection, use, access (or prohibit access), processing, performance, disclosure, display, sharing, response to law process or otherwise exercise our rights under applicable law to transfer, store, sell, lease, retain, commingle, investigate, verify, certify, enforce, delete and otherwise process Personal Information and information other than Personal Information.


### 4. Children

The Services comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). MangoFun does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 through the Services.

In addition, we will not collect, store or use any personal information from users who identify themselves as children under the age of 13 while on the Services or in connection with any content or software. If we receive or become aware of personal information provided by a child under the age of 13, MangoFun will immediately delete such personal information in a secure manner.


### 5. Security

MangoFun maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the personal information we collect and store about our account holders, including children under the age of 13. Personal information collected by MangoFun is stored in a secure operating environment, which is disclosed to and only authorized employees can access. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control (i.e. to maintain data quality).


### 6. Links to third-party websites or services

You should be aware that the Hat Service may from time to time contain links to third-party websites, products or services. MangoFun is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such sites or services. If you are concerned about a third party's privacy policy, we recommend that you read the privacy policy of the website or service you link to before submitting any personal information.


### 7. Changes to the Privacy Policy

MangoFun may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. All changes here will be made available on this website, which is why MangoFun encourages users to check this page frequently for any changes to this Privacy Policy. Changes to it without the consent of the user will not prejudice the rights of the user.
